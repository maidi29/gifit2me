    <p>GIF it 2 me is a turn-based real-time party game for 3 to 9 players. It is similar to "Cards Against Humanity" or "What do you meme?"</p>
    <p>In each round another player is the master and thinks of a situation (or chooses from a selection of example
      situations) to which the players must find a suitable, preferably funny GIF. They can search the Giphy database
      to do this.</p>
    <p>As soon as all players have submitted a GIF, the master starts to reveal them. Then he decides which of the answers
      is the funniest and chooses it as the winner. The corresponding player receives a point and the role of the master
      changes to the next player, whose turn it is to think up a situation.</p>
    <p>The game ends as soon as each player has been master as many times as defined in the number of runs at the
      beginning.</p>
