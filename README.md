GIF it 2 me is a turn-based real-time party game for 3 to 9 players.

each round another player is the game leader and thinks of a situation (or chooses from a selection of example situations) 
to which the players must find a suitable, preferably funny GIF. They can search the Giphy database to do this.

As soon as all players have submitted a GIF, the master starts to reveal them. Then he decides which of the answers is the 
funniest and chooses it as the winner. The corresponding player receives a point and the role of the master changes to the 
next player, whose turn it is to think up a situation.

The game ends when the players decide to do so and the winner is whoever has the most points at that moment.
